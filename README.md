# MorseEncoder

This project implements a microcontroller-based system that takes keyboard input, converts it into Morse code, and then transmits it as a light and/or sound signal.

Features

- Accepts input from a keyboard (via USB or Bluetooth module).

- Converts text into corresponding Morse code.

Transmits the signal using:

- Light emitter (e.g., LED)

- Sound emitter (e.g., buzzer)
